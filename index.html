          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
            <li>Stands for Hypertext Markup Language, one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development, used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
            <li>Elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage</li>
            <li>Elements used to add content to pages: text, image, header, list</li>
            <li>Elements used to divide and describe a page: meta-related, content division, semantic</li>
            <li>Head element contains metadata that helps the browser render the page correctly; not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
            <li>Body element contains the content shown to the user; all the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element</li>
            <li>Metadata tags: title defines title for webpage, style defines CSS styles associated w/ website, base defines base URL, link connects an external resource to the HTML document, meta defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author, viewpoint, script embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
            <li>Charset sets character encoding, http-equiv sets an HTTP header for content, viewport sets default view</li>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag</li>

          <li>Stands for Cascading Style Sheets, gives the content style</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline, internal style sheet, external style sheet</li>
          <li>Inline: developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet - embed style sheet directly in HTML file</li>
          <li>External style sheet - allows developers to keep CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two components: property we want to apply and value of the property</li>
          <li>Margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element - adds a buffer</li>
          <li>Padding adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>link element creates connection to external file</li>
          <li>Rel specifies relationship between current document and linked document resource</li>
          <li>href specifies the URL of the external resource, using a relative path</li>

          <li>Period after card designates class selector - any HTML element assigned to the class card will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
