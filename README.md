# Columbia Engineering Bootcamp's Prework: Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I made this project, the Prework Study Guide, to store notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Its intention is to be used as a resource throughout my tenure in the bootcamp. This was my introduction to these topics, and building this website was prescribed with the intention of garnering a foundation in these topics.

## Usage

Third parties can use this website by reading and reviewing the notes in each section. I added a "General Notes" section as well to give beginners (including myself) more context. To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There a user can see the JavaScript running. In the console panel, there will appear a list of topics discovered in the prework along with a suggestion regarding which to study first.
